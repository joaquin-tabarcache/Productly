# Basic Django Project - Python Course from YouTube Channel "Hola mundo"

This is a basic Django project based on a Python course from the YouTube channel "Hola mundo." Through this project, I've learned the fundamental principles of Django, HTML, and the usage of the Bootstrap library. I've gained knowledge about the common use of forms to add products to a database with properties such as category, stock, name, and score.

## Learned Features

- Use of Django to create web applications.
- Handling forms in Django to gather user information.
- Incorporating styles and visual design using the Bootstrap library.
- Interacting with databases to store and retrieve information.
- Understanding the basic structure of a Django project and its workflow.
